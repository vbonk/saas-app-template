## Security Best Practices

### For Template Users

When using this template, follow these security practices:

#### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files containing secrets
- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use environment-specific configurations

#### Authentication
- Enable MFA for all admin accounts
- Use strong JWT secrets (min 256 bits)
- Implement proper session management
- Set appropriate token expiration times

#### API Security
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- Validate all input data
- Use HTTPS in production
- Enable CORS properly
- Implement proper error handling (no sensitive data in errors)

#### Database Security
- Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
- Enable SSL connections
- Regular database backups
- Implement proper access controls

#### Infrastructure Security
- Use Railway's security features
- Enable automatic security updates
- Monitor for vulnerabilities with Snyk
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

### Secure Configuration

#### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Strong JWT secrets (use openssl rand -base64 32)
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-strong-secret-here

# Database with SSL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require

# Secure webhook secrets
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

#### Security Headers
The template includes these security headers:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy restrictions

### Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All secrets in environment variables (not hardcoded)
- [ ] HTTPS enabled and enforced
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive data
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning enabled
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

## Known Security Considerations

### Template-Specific
- Default rate limits should be adjusted based on your use case
- Clerk webhook validation is critical for security
- Stripe webhook validation must be properly implemented
- Database migrations should be reviewed for security implications

### Third-Party Dependencies
- We use Snyk for automatic vulnerability scanning
- Dependabot is enabled for security updates
- Regular manual audits of critical dependencies

## Security Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **Email:** security@example.com
- **PGP Key:** [Link to public key if available]
- **Response Time:** 24-48 hours
